    "\n",
    "This session demonstrates the building blocks capabilities of your AWS DeepLens to extend the functionality of the projects to interact with other AWS services. For example, you can build a dashboard and search interface for all objects and faces detected by AWS DeepLens by integrating your AWS DeepLens with Amazon ElasticSearch or build anomaly detection models on the number of people walking in front of your store by integrating AWS DeepLens with Amazon Kinesis Analytics or use celebrity recognition and face search API to identify the VIP around you by integrating AWS DeepLens with Amazon Rekognition.\n",

    "1. Create a lambda function\n",
