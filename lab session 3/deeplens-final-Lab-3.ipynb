    "# Editing a model in Amazon SageMaker \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will learn to edit a pre-trained object recognition model to perform a binary classification to classify an object as either a Hotdog or Not Hotdog. This fun exercise is based on a popular sitcom and demonstrates the extensibility of AWS DeepLens. We will edit the model in Amazon SageMaker. Amazon SageMaker is an end to end machine learning platform to train and host your models to production. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will learn to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load your notebook into Amazon SageMaker notebook instance\n",
    "2. Train your model in the notebook\n",
    "3. Save your model artifacts into your S3 bucket\n",
    "4. Import the model artifacts to DeepLens\n"
